# Parsley Helpers

A scaffold for some of the common functions that we typically want to use with the Parsley JS validation library. In particular, functions that help Parsley to play well with conditionally shown/hidden form fields.

These functions are all based in jQuery (as Parsley itself is).

Lots more documentation can be found in the code itself.
