# Parsley Helpers

A scaffold for some useful functions to be used with the [Parsley JS validation library](http://parsleyjs.org/). In particular, functions that help Parsley to play well with conditionally shown/hidden form fields.

These functions are all based in jQuery (as Parsley itself is).

Lots more documentation can be found in the code itself.
